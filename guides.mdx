## What is W&B?

W&B is the AI developer platform, with tools for training models, fine-tuning models, and leveraging foundation models.

W&B consists of three major components: [Models](/guides/models), [Weave](https://wandb.github.io/weave/), and [Core](/guides/core/):

**[W&B Models](/guides/models/)** is a set of lightweight, interoperable tools for machine learning practitioners training and fine-tuning models.
- [Experiments](/guides/models/track/): Machine learning experiment tracking
- [Sweeps](/guides/models/sweeps/): Hyperparameter tuning and model optimization
- [Registry](/guides/core/registry/): Publish and share your ML models and datasets

**[W&B Weave](/guides/weave/)** is a lightweight toolkit for tracking and evaluating LLM applications.

**[W&B Core](/guides/core/)** is set of powerful building blocks for tracking and visualizing data and models, and communicating results.
- [Artifacts](/guides/core/artifacts/): Version assets and track lineage
- [Tables](/guides/models/tables/): Visualize and query tabular data
- [Reports](/guides/core/reports/): Document and collaborate on your discoveries

**[W&B Inference](/guides/inference/)** is a set of tools for accessing open-source foundation models through W&B Weave and an OpenAI-compatible API.

## How does W&B work?

Read the following sections in this order if you are a first-time user of W&B and you are interested in training, tracking, and visualizing machine learning models and experiments:

1. Learn about [runs](/guides/models/track/runs/), W&B's basic unit of computation.
2. Create and track machine learning experiments with [Experiments](/guides/models/track/).
3. Discover W&B's flexible and lightweight building block for dataset and model versioning with [Artifacts](/guides/core/artifacts/).
4. Automate hyperparameter search and explore the space of possible models with [Sweeps](/guides/models/sweeps/).
5. Manage the model lifecycle from training to production with [Registry](/guides/core/registry/).
6. Visualize predictions across model versions with our [Data Visualization](/guides/models/tables/) guide.
7. Organize runs, embed and automate visualizations, describe your findings, and share updates with collaborators with [Reports](/guides/core/reports/).
